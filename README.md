# hellorest

A minimal Go API returning {"hello": "world"} on a GET / request

A trivial Go API returning `{"hello": "world"}` on a `GET /` request. This project is designed as a simple Docker container to test API responses and configurations.

All other verbs and paths return a 404.

## Purpose

This Docker image provides a minimal REST API for testing. It can be used to validate deployment setups, networking, or any environment that needs a basic HTTP server with predictable behavior.

This is intended to be deployed as a place holder to test various API and microservice components.
